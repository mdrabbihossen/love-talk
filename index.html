          <p class="quote">
            Hasina, I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I
            love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way
            because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which
            there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my
            hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close. <br />
            Hasina, Your love shines in my heart as the sun that shines upon the
            earth. <br />
            Hasina, You are imperfect, permanently and inevitably flawed. And
            you are beautiful. <br />
            Hasina, Do you Know? A hundred hearts would be too few to carry all
            my love for you. <br />
            Hasina, Trust me I love you more than I can express, or can ever
            hope to express. <br />
            Truly Every day I’m convinced that I can’t possibly love you more…
            and every day I’m proven wrong.
          </p>
